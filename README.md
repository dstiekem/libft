# libft

run `make re` to clean any archive files and recompile the library

## ABCs
first ever project at WeThinkCode_ a tedious but necessary introduction to system functions at the lowest level we could be yet capable of. 
The library has functions handling string manipulation, memory allocation and outputing to file descriptors. Things we take for granted! 
It taught us control flows, the difference between stack and heap, structuring and styling to a militant level of precision, how to parse integers as strings and vice versa, and testing code for every case we could think of. A very rewarding library to then eventually use in future projects like get_next_line and ft_ls.
